# Python Driver for I2C Devices

This repository contains the common I2C driver used by various Sensirion
sensor drivers. For details, please read the package description in
[README.rst](README.rst).


## Usage

See package description in [README.rst](README.rst) and user manual at
https://sensirion.github.io/python-i2c-driver/.

## Development

We develop and test this driver using our company internal tools (version
control, continuous integration, code review etc.) and automatically
synchronize the `master` branch with GitHub. But this doesn't mean that we
don't respond to issues or don't accept pull requests on GitHub. In fact,
you're very welcome to open issues or create pull requests :)
